a Sinclair ZX Spectrum emulator [CSpect](https://dailly.blogspot.com/) or
[ZEsarUX](https://sourceforge.net/projects/zesarux/).

2. Download the zxnext_tilemap repository either as a ZIP archive using the
"Clone or download" button at the top of this page or with Git using the
following command:

> git clone https://github.com/headkaze/zxnext_tilemap.git

3. Go to the zxnext_tilemap directory and enter the following command:

> make

4. Run the zxnext_tilemap/bin/zxnext_tilemap.nex file in your
Sinclair ZX Spectrum emulator.
